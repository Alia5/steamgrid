Steam Grid Downloader
---------------------

The Steam client has a neat grid view for your games, but it comes looking like
this:

Steam allows you to set custom images for each tile, but doesn't give any by
default. There are many tile images available online, but you still have to
change each game individually.

Not anymore. This nifty program fills the grid for you, automatically:

Just [download the executable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/boppreh/steamgrid/master/steamgrid.exe) and run it, no installation required. The program
detects and downloads everything automatically, going as far as doing Google
image searches to fill the gaps in the official repositories. The images you
may already have will not be touched.

If you encounter any problems please open an issue or email me. All critics and
suggestions welcome.
